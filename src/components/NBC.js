            <br />
            At Nylia Ballet Company, we inspire and cultivate a vibrant
            community of dancers and enthusiasts by embracing ballet's
            transformative power. Our Company consists of dancers who work
            full-time, non-dance jobs but still train professionally. We believe
            ballet is for everyone. Thus, by offering diverse artistic
            performances and outreach programs, we strive to share the beauty of
            dance and enrich the cultural heritage of the El Paso Borderland
            community. Our mission is to foster a community that reflects the
            diversity of our world, welcoming anyone who wishes to participate,
            regardless of age, skills, or experience.

          <h2>Nylia Ballet's Performing Company</h2>

          <p>
            <br />
            Founded in 2024, the Company operates on a three-season calendar,
            each season providing the region with the highest-quality
            productions. Nylia Ballet Company (NBC) offers a repertoire of
            classical and contemporary ballets, with specialized instructors
            using Balanchine and Vaganova methods. As we embark on this
            programming, in our positionality as a Borderland City, we
            collaborate with other area performing arts and cultural groups,
            always centering educational outreach.
            <br /> <br />
            Newly led by Artistic Director Grace McCoy, who has performed with
            Tulsa Ballet and trained at Tulsa Ballet, The Kirov Academy, Boston
            Ballet, Ellison Ballet, and the Marais Ballet School in Paris, the
            El Paso-based Company instills impeccable technique through staple
            classical ballets and new premieres of contemporary works during its
            2024 - 2025 season.
            <br /> <br />
            Our inclusive approach to classical ballet is a response to the
            current and historic barriers to excellent dance training in the
            larger field. The Nylia Ballet Company is countercultural to the
            elitism and exclusionary practices commonly seen in the world of
            ballet training. At the Nylia Ballet Academy, all dancers are valued
            and empowered to pursue their passion for dance.
